/**
 * A component that you can use in your game interface to display a set of elements of the same size that need to be arranged in single or multiple lines. Usually used for displaying cards and tokens in a flexible way. This component can be used to:
 * - Display a set of cards, typically hands (examples: Hearts, Seasons, The Boss, Race for the Galaxy).
 * - Display items in player panels (examples: Takenoko, Amyitis, ...)
 * - Black dice and cubes on cards in Troyes are displayed with stock components.
 * @requires ebg/stock must be included in the define as a dependency.
 * @see {@link https://en.boardgamearena.com/doc/Stock|Documentation}
 * 
 * 
 * Most cases will be one of the following situations:
 * 
 * Situation A:
 * 
 * When you add a card to a stock item, and this card is not coming from another stock:
 * Use addToStockWithId with a "from" argument set to the element of your interface where the card should come from (i.e. div id). For example if you want to "reveal" card from player hand and it is not an interface element you can set from to be 'player_board_'+activePlayerId (where activePlayerId is player who played that card).
 * 
 * Situation B:
 * 
 * When you add a card to a stock item, and this card is coming from another stock:
 * On the destination Stock, use addToStockWithId with a "from" argument which is the HTML id of the corresponding item in the source Stock. For example, if the source stock id is "myHand", then the HTML id of card 48 is "myHand_item_48".
 * Then, remove the source item with removeFromStockById. Note: do NOT set the 'to' argument in this call, otherwise you'll get two animations.
 * (Note that it's important to do things in this order, because the source item must still exist when you use it as the origin of the slide.)
 * 
 * Situation C:
 * 
 * When you move a card from a stock item to something that is not a stock item:
 * Insert the card as a classic HTML template (dojo.place / this.format_block).
 * Place it on the Stock item with this.placeOnObject, using the Stock item HTML id (see above).
 * Slide it to its new position with this.slideToObject.
 * Remove the card from the Stock item with removeFromStockById.
 * 
 * Using the methods above, your cards should slide to, from, and between your Stock controls smoothly.
