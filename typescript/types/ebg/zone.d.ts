/**
 * The Zone component is meant to organise items of the same type inside a predefined space.
 * 
 * Zones are not great at responsive design and are intended for fixed-size spaces. If you want a responsive zone-like structure, you should use the {@link Stock} component instead.
 * @example
 * // Zone's always target an existing HTML element. In your template file, define the area you want to use as a zone. This should be styled to have a fixed size, or us should use the 'SetFluidWidth' method to make it responsive.
 * <div id="my_zone" style="width: 100px;"></div>
 * 
 * // Then create the zone and set the pattern you want to use to organize the items.
 * this.my_zone = new ebg.zone();
 * this.my_zone.create(this, $('my_zone'), <item_width>, <item_height>);
 * this.my_zone.setPattern( <mode> ); // See 'setPattern' for available modes.
 * 
 * // Then you can add and remove items using their DOM ids:
 * this.my_zone.placeInZone( <item_id> );
 * this.my_zone.removeFromZone( <item_id> );
* The interface for the `ebg/zone` module.
* Partial: This has been partially typed based on a subset of the BGA source code.
