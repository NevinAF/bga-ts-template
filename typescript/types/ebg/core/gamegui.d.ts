/**
 * The main class for a game interface. This should always define:
 * - How to setup user interface.
 * - Which actions on the page will generate calls to the server.
 * - What happens when you get a notification for a change from the server and how it will show in the browser.
 * 
 * In a bit more detail, it should include the following methods and sections:
 * - `constructor`: here you can define global variables for your whole interface.
 * - `setup`: this method is called when the page is refreshed, and sets up the game interface.
 * - `onEnteringState`: this method is called when entering a new game state. You can use it to customize the view for each game state.
 * - `onLeavingState`: this method is called when leaving a game state.
 * - `onUpdateActionButtons`: called on state changes, in order to add action buttons to the status bar. Note: in a multipleactiveplayer state, it will be called when another player has become inactive.
 * - (utility methods): this is where you can define your utility methods.
 * - (player's actions): this is where you can write your handlers for player actions on the interface (example: click on an item).
 * - `setupNotifications`: this method associates notifications with notification handlers. For each game notification, you can trigger a javascript method to handle it and update the game interface.
 * - (notification handlers): this is where you define the notifications handlers associated with notifications in setupNotifications, above.
 * 
 * All clients automatically load the Dojo framework, so all games can use the functions to do more coimplex things more easily. The BGA framework uses Dojo extensively. See {@link http://dojotoolkit.org/ | Dojo Javascript framework} for more information. In addition, the BGA framework defines a jQuery-like function $ that you can use to access the DOM. This function is available in all BGA pages and is the standard way to access the DOM in BGA. You can use getElementById but a longer to type and less handy as it does not do some checks.
 * 
 * For performance reasons, when deploying a game the javascript code is minimized using {@link https://github.com/terser/terser | terser}. This minifier works with modern javascript syntax. From your project "Manage game" page, you can now test a minified version of your javascript on the studio (and revert to the original).
 * 
 * Partial: This has been partially typed based on a subset of the BGA source code.
 * 
 * Using the built-in dojo define method, you should usually define and initialize prototype variables using the constructor method; however, when using classes, any global variables should be added to the class as fields with initializers, like normal for typescript.
 * @example
 * // Dojo + Define
 * define(Gamegui, {
 * 	constructor(){
 * 		console.log('yourgamename constructor');
 * 		this.myGlobalValue = 0;
 * 	},
 * 	...
 * });
 * 
 * // TS Class
 * class YourGameName extends Gamegui {
 * 	myGlobalValue = 0;
 * 	constructor(){
 * 		super();
 * 		console.log('yourgamename constructor');
 * 	}
 * 	...
 * }
* Partial: This has been partially typed based on a subset of the BGA source code.
