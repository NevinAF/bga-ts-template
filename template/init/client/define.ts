/**
 * Adds type safety to the default define method specified by the Dojo Toolkit. For simplicity, this has been restricted to defining the game specific module, requiring the game to be defined as a class.
 * @param dependencies The dependencies required for the game class to be defined.
 * @param callback The function that will define the game class and return it.
 * - param `_dojo`: The dojo library. This should not be used but instead the global `dojo` object should be used.
 * - param `declare`: The declare function used to create the module.
 * - - param `module_name`: The name of the module to be defined. Should be 'bgagame.yourgamename'.
 * - - param `base_class`: The target to define the module on. Should be `ebg.core.gamegui`.
 * - - param `module`: The game class to be defined. Should be a new instance of the game class: `new YourGameName()`.
 * @example
 * define([
 * 	"dojo",
 * 	"dojo/_base/declare",
 * 	"ebg/core/gamegui",
 * 	"ebg/counter",
 * ],
 * function (dojo, declare) {
